## 📁 Project Components

### 1. **EV Drivetrain Modeling**
- Simulated a full **EV drivetrain** including:
  - Battery
  - Motor
  - Inverter
  - Transmission
  - Wheels
- Used **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, and **Simscape Electrical**.

### 2. **Drive Cycle Analysis**
- Evaluated performance using standard drive cycles:
  - UDDS (Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule)
  - HWFET (Highway Fuel Economy Test)
  - WLTP (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure)
- Measured:
  - Energy consumption (Wh/km)
  - Motor efficiency
  - Regenerative braking effectiveness

### 3. **Regenerative Braking System**

- Designed a regenerative braking system to **harvest kinetic energy** during deceleration.
- Used a **DC motor model** with **chopper-based control** and current feedback to simulate braking torque.
- Stored recovered energy in a capacitor or battery bank.

### 4. **Packaging and Structural Feasibility**
- Modeled the **chassis and component layout** in **SolidWorks**.
- Evaluated:
  - Packaging constraints
